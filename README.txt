This file includes a LaTeX template that attempts to conform to the guidelines established by the UTPA's Graduate School office.


The original author of this template is Guillermo Garza ggarzaz39@utpa.edu

Warnings:
Loading the fontenc, amssyb, and microtype package will cause typesetting to fail.

TODO: 
- Add bibliography info to abstract page.  The major obstacle is that LaTeX does not do underlining well.  
- Subsection heading does not conform to UTPA standards.
