\chapter{DCE in a Periodic Potential} %\label{ch:system}


\section{Statement of the Problem}

We want to study the DCE in a superconducting circuit as in (Johansson). We characterize the circuit in terms of dynamical fluxes $\Phi_i$. Assuming a symmetric SQUID, with its plasma frequency far exceeding the characteristic frequencies of the circuit $\Phi_J/\Phi_0$. The Lagrangian for the system is:

\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left(\Delta x C_{0} \left(\dot{\Phi}_{i}\right)^{2} - \
\end{equation}
