\Abstract{%
  \noindent Citizen, John Q.,
  \uline{Titles Should Not Exceed Six Inches on One Line and In The Inverted Pyramid Format When Additional Lines Are Needed}.
  Master of Science (MS),
  May 2014,
  \pageref{LastPage} pages,
  ??  tables,
  ?? figures,
  \total{citesnum} references,
  \total{citnum} titles.

  An abstract is a brief summary often used to help the reader quickly
  ascertain the paper's purpose.  The UTPA thesis manual requires your abstract
  to have the bibliography style citation above. The latex macros above
  count pages, tables, and references. The command
  `noindent' prevents indention.  Unfortunately, the author of this template
  hasn't figured out a way to cunt tables and figure reliably. You will have to
  insert the counts for those manually.
