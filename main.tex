 \Abstract{The abstract is double spaced, including the heading, which begins
two inches down from the top of the page. Note that the abstract title is
underlined and that any italicized words are not underlined (in order to
indicate italics).  If an abstract title contains scientific terminology
requiring italics, such terminology should be treated in the same manner. Do
not use italic print in the abstract title.  Right and left margins are the
same as for the body of the thesis. Note that the author's name and thesis
title must be identical on the title page, the approval page, and the
abstract heading. The date of graduation is the same as that shown on the
title page. The number of titles is the number of items in the bibliography
or reference list. Word limits are 150 for master's theses and 350 for
doctoral dissertations. Count numbers as words, hyphenated words as two
words. Acronyms, abbreviations, and initials as words. }
